1) [resolved in 0.11] hi-side driver: the part number is for SOIC package but the board has MSOP package. Part number should be TC4427AEUA
2) todo: add full 25x2 silkscreen on the back
3) todo: hi-side net names are weird: control line indeces do not match output line indeces
4) TODO: 5v power pin with a jumper - that's for a HD44780 so that power could be turned on/off
5) diode part number is not exactly right: 497-2521-1-ND is a single diode, VCC side stays unprotected
6) rename 'inj-X' to 'low-X' to reduce confusion?
7) draw VBatt wiring on the back of the board?
8) VP label silkscreen should be improved
9) "5v 5v GND" silkscreen on the back is wrong - one of the pins is 3v. todo: check power silkscreen on the front

10) a jumper to connect VP to +5
11) a jumper to connect W211 to PC6
12) a jumper to connect W212 to PA5
